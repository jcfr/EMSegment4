The EMSegment extension for Slicer4.

Until some infrastructure is ready, it is required to perform the following steps to successfully compile EMSegment4:

  1. create a symbolic link named 'EMS', pointing to a Slicer3/Modules/EMSegment/ directory, in the Slicer4/QTModules/EMSegment4/ directory.
  2. copy Slicer3-build/Modules/EMSegment/vtkEMSegmentConfigure.h to Slicer4-Superbuild/Slicer-build/QTModules/EMSegment4/EMS/

Cheers :)
